# Reaction-Diffusion Models Analysis and Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains work focused on the analysis and simulation of reaction-diffusion models, approached from a biological perspective. The project was carried out using MATLAB to implement and simulate various reaction-diffusion systems.

## Language

The entire project was conducted in Spanish, as it was developed as part of a course where Spanish was the primary language of instruction. Therefore, code comments, documentation, and the PDF report are all in Spanish.

## How to Use

If you're interested in replicating or extending this work, feel free to explore the codebase (matlab files).
